# ml-basics
This repository is a personal project to build foundational ML components from scratch. The goal is to have a framework similar to sklearn, with a straightforward Python version for ease of use and a Rust Implementation for performance-oriented version. Note: This repository is under construction. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
