# ml-basics

This repository is a personal project to build foundational ML components from scratch. The goal is to have a framework similar to sklearn, with a straightforward Python version for ease of use. Note: This repository is under construction. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## TODO:

- Implement iterative methods for large datasets in Ridge regression
- Implement Lasso regression
